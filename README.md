Crafted Finishes wants to implement a DAO Framework for profit sharing in their company. What is a DAO?

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization governed by code (smart contracts) on a blockchain, rather than traditional management structures. It enables decisions to be made collectively by its members, usually through token-based voting systems. In this context:

_Treasury_: Funds collected from project profits that are shared among the DAO members (employees).
_Governance_: The system would allow members to decide on treasury reinvestment or profit withdrawal based on predefined rules.
_Transparency_: DAO models often emphasize transparency, with all transactions and decisions recorded on a blockchain.
